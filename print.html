<div style="text-align: right"> <i> No one reads introductions anyway. <br> — Sun Tzu </i> </div>
<p>Long gone are the times when JavaScript was just a scripting language to add simple interactive behaviour to websites. The ECMAScript 2015 standard significantly improved the usability of the language. Excellent UI libraries like React allow you to write straightforward declarative code which massively simplifies building user interfaces. Thanks to Node.js you can write JavaScript on the server. Express.js empowers you to write complex APIs very quickly and MongoDB provides a document-oriented database that fits right in with the other tools. The MERN stack (<strong>M</strong>ongoDb, <strong>E</strong>xpress.js, <strong>R</strong>eact, <strong>N</strong>ode.js) therefore allows you to quickly develop complex applications using just one language - JavaScript (with optional static typing via TypeScript).</p>
<p>This book serves as an introduction to the MERN stack. However you don't learn software development by <em>just</em> reading books, you learn it by creating projects. We will therefore not bombard you with useless language trivia for hundreds of pages. If you care about that, go read the standard - it's <em>pretty comprehensive</em>. Instead we will create a real software project - an application for managing tasks called <strong>easy-opus</strong> (get it?). We will begin with nothing more than an empty project directory and the <em>will to learn</em>. We will end with a useful piece of software that allows us to create tasks, assign tasks to different users, update their statuses and much more. </p>
<p>This book is therefore <em>inherently practical</em> - unlike some other literature we will not dwell much on theoretical considerations. On the other hand, purely practical concerns are first-class citizens here (for example there is an entire chapter devoted to hosting your application). This doesn't mean that <em>theory bad, practice good</em>. It simply means that the approach for <em>this particular book</em> is heavily geared towards completing a real software project.</p>
<p>This book is therefore also <em>not</em> about becoming <em>yet another JavaScript guru</em>™ (there are already too many of them). It's about writing a useful product. It is fundamentally about <strong>getting things done</strong>. The MERN stack is really just a tool we use to get things done.</p>
<p>This book is suitable for both beginners who want to pick up their first tech stack as well as for seasoned software developers looking to expand their knowledge.</p>
<p>This book is intended to be a standalone resource. While there are resources for further reading in each section, these are merely pointers if you want to dive deeper into a certain topic. You <em>don't have</em> to read them and you should be able to understand everything without reading them. In fact, if you are hard stuck in a certain place, this probably represents a failure on our part. Maybe we didn't explain an important concept well enough (or at all!). Don't hesitate to write an email to <code>uhasker@protonmail.com</code> or to create an issue at <code>https://github.com/uhasker/getting-things-done-in-mern</code> explaining your problem.</p>
<p><em>Happy hacking</em></p>

<div style="text-align: right"> <i> JavaScript has beauty, but not everyone sees it. <br> - Confucius </i> </div>
<p>First we will need to go through the basics of the JavaScript language that we will use pretty much everywhere throughout this book. After all the MERN stack is built on top of it.</p>
<p>You will setup your runtime, learn about variables, data types, operators and control flow. You will also learn how to write functions and how to think <em>functionally</em>. Thinking <em>functionally</em> will make you a better software developer and a better person. Isn't that great?</p>
<p>Let's dive right in!</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h2 id="hello-world"><a class="header" href="#hello-world">Hello world</a></h2>
<div style="text-align: right"> <i> A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single "Hello, world!" program. <br> — Ancient Chinese proverb </i> </div>
<h3 id="runtime-environments"><a class="header" href="#runtime-environments">Runtime environments</a></h3>
<p>Contrary to popular belief, code sadly doesn't run on magic or unicorn tears. Instead, it runs on something called a <strong>runtime</strong> (also referred to as <em>runtime environment</em>). Put simply, a runtime is a program capable of executing code written in some programming language. It <em>provides the environment in which programs can run</em>. In order to execute all the <em>awesome</em> JavaScript code we are about to write, we therefore need a runtime first.</p>
<p>There are two runtimes capable of executing JavaScript code which are relevant to this book - the browser and Node.js. Every runtime environment comes with a <strong>console</strong> which allows us to interact with and observe the output of JavaScript code.</p>
<p>In this section we will setup the browser and Node.js runtimes. Then we will print &quot;Hello, world!&quot; both to the browser console and to the Node.js console to test that our setup works as expected.</p>
<h3 id="the-browser-environment"><a class="header" href="#the-browser-environment">The browser environment</a></h3>
<p>Open a browser and open the console in your browser. If you are using <em>Firefox</em> the shortcut for opening the console is <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>K</kbd> on Windows or Linux and <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>K</kbd> on a Mac. If you are using <em>Chrome</em> or <em>Microsoft Edge</em> the shortcut is <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>J</kbd> on Windows or Linux and <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>Option</kbd> + <kbd>J</kbd> on a Mac.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you are using Internet Explorer, please navigate to <code>google.com</code> and search for &quot;Firefox&quot; to install a <em>real</em> browser. This line was originally intended to be a funny joke, but on June 15, 2022 Microsoft ended support for Internet Explorer, so it's not even a joke anymore. We recommend Firefox, but this is purely a personal preference. Chrome and Microsoft Edge are absolutely fine as well.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is how the browser console will approximately look like on Firefox:</p>
<p><img src="chapter1/images/browser-console.png" alt="" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that if you see a bunch of scary error or warning messages upon opening the console, <em>don't panic</em> (this is also good life advice in general). Most of these will probably come from various extensions you might have installed or the web page you are currently viewing. Simply delete the messages by clicking the icon in the top left of the console (trash can in Firefox - might vary in different browsers), as we don't care about them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The browser as well as the Node.js console have <strong>REPL</strong> (read-eval-print-loop) capabilities. This just means that you can type some code into the console directly and execute it. REPLs are very nice, because they allow you to quickly test what you just learned.</p>
<p>Let's print something using the <code>console.log</code> method. Type the following into the browser console:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">console.log(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;);
</code></pre>
<p>Now hit <kbd>Return</kbd> (you may also know this as <kbd>Enter</kbd> or simply <kbd>⏎</kbd>). You will see the output &quot;Hello, world!&quot; in the console:</p>
<p><img src="chapter1/images/browser-console-log.png" alt="" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ignore the &quot;undefined&quot; for now.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hooray, we printed something to the browser console! This is the point at which you go tell everyone that you are now a <em>programmer</em>™.</p>
<h3 id="executing-javascript-from-an-html-file"><a class="header" href="#executing-javascript-from-an-html-file">Executing JavaScript from an HTML file</a></h3>
<p>Instead of executing JavaScript in the browser console directly, we can (and often will) execute it from an HTML file. HTML is short for <em>HyperText Markup Language</em> and is the standard markup language for documents that should be displayed in a browser. We will cover HTML in chapter 2 - for now we just want to get a quick glimpse at it.</p>
<p>Create a new HTML file. We will call it <em>hello.html</em>, however you can name it whatever you want. The filename should have an <em>html</em> extension though.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you are on a Windows machine, you probably cannot create a file with an <code>html</code> extension directly. In that case simply create an empty <code>txt</code> file and change the extension to <code>html</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Open the HTML file in any text editor (we recommend you use <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com">Visual Studio Code</a>) and add the following text to the file:</p>
<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
  &lt;script&gt;
    console.log(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;);
  &lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Don't forget to save the file!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note the semicolon after the console.log. It terminates the <code>console.log</code> statement. The semicolon is not technically required here. Indeed there are many JavaScript programmers who don't write semicolons. However to avoid a bunch of pitfalls we will use semicolons throughout this book and therefore we want you to get used to them as soon as possible.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now open this file in your browser. If the <code>html</code> file extension is associated with your browser, you should be able to do so by simply double-clicking the file. If this is not the case, <em>right-click</em> the file. A menu containing the option &quot;Open with&quot; should pop up. Click on any browser name from the &quot;Open with&quot; submenu. This is how it would look like on Windows 11:</p>
<p><img src="chapter1/images/open-with.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Alternatively just copy the path of the file and paste it into the address bar of your browser prefixed by <code>file:///</code>. For example if the file name is <code>C:/Users/Example/Desktop/hello.html</code>, you can open the file by typing <code>file:///C:/Users/Example/Desktop/hello.html</code> into the address bar and hitting <kbd>Return</kbd>:</p>
<p><img src="chapter1/images/address-bar.png" alt="" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p>You can find out the path of a file by right-clicking the file and selecting <em>Properties</em>. The window that opens should show the file location.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After opening this file in your browser, open the console again. You should see &quot;Hello, world!&quot; printed there.</p>
<h3 id="nodejs"><a class="header" href="#nodejs">Node.js</a></h3>
<p>For a long time, programmers used JavaScript mostly inside the browser runtime environment. However in 2009 Node.js came along and changed that by allowing programmers to easily run JavaScript outside the browser.</p>
<p>Node.js will probably not be installed on your machine, so let's fix that. Grab Node.js from <code>https://nodejs.org</code>:</p>
<p><img src="chapter1/images/node-js.png" alt="" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that by the time you are reading this book the Node.js version you see on <code>https://nodejs.org</code> might be different.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You want to download the LTS (long term support) version. Click the big green button with the <em>LTS</em> version. This will download a Windows installer file. Execute the installer file just like you would execute any installer by double-clicking it. You will be presented with a bunch of options during the installation - just click &quot;Next&quot; everywhere and you will be fine.</p>
<p>Now we need to open a <strong>command-line interface</strong> (also called command line, command prompt or CLI) on our computer. A command line allows you to execute various tasks (called commands) on your computer.</p>
<p>On Windows, you can open the CLI by opening the &quot;Run&quot; window using <kbd>Win</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd>, typing <em>cmd</em> and pressing the &quot;Ok&quot; button:</p>
<p><img src="chapter1/images/run-window.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Alternatively you can type &quot;cmd&quot; into the search field. An app called &quot;command prompt&quot; should show up. Simply click the app and a CLI should open:</p>
<p><img src="chapter1/images/search-field.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>No matter how you do it, you should now stare at a <em>beautiful</em> command line. Take a second and <em>bask in it's glory</em> for a while.</p>
<p>After you're done basking, let's try and execute a command. For example we can use the <code>echo</code> command to output text. Try typing the following in your CLI:</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">echo &quot;Hello, world!&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Now hit <kbd>Return</kbd> and you should see the following result:</p>
<p><img src="chapter1/images/cli.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Note that on a Mac you can open the command line by hitting <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>Space</kbd> to open <em>search</em>, typing <em>terminal</em> and hitting <kbd>Return</kbd>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you're on a Linux system you should <em>really</em> know how to open a command line.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now that the command line is open, execute the <code>node</code> command to open a Node.js console. You can do so by typing <code>node</code> and hitting <kbd>Return</kbd>. You should see something like the following (again the Node.js version might be different):</p>
<p><img src="chapter1/images/cli-node.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Now let's again print &quot;Hello, world!&quot; using the <code>console.log</code> method. Type the following into the Node.js console and hit <kbd>Return</kbd>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">console.log(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;);
</code></pre>
<p>You should see &quot;Hello, world!&quot; printed to the console:</p>
<p><img src="chapter1/images/node-js-console-log.png" alt="" /></p>
<h3 id="executing-a-file"><a class="header" href="#executing-a-file">Executing a file</a></h3>
<p>Before moving on, let's execute a JavaScript file containing some code. Create a file named <code>hello.js</code>. Open the file in any text editor (preferably Visual Studio Code) and add the following content to the file:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">console.log(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;);
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>If you are on a Windows machine, you probably cannot create a file with a <code>js</code> extension directly. In that case simply create an empty <code>txt</code> file and change the extension to <code>js</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again open a command line and <em>change the current directory location to the directory containing the JavaScript file</em>. You can do so using the <em>cd</em> command. For example if <code>hello.js</code> is located at <code>C:/Users/Example/Desktop</code> you would execute the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">cd C:/Users/Example/Desktop
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>You can find out the directory containing the JavaScript file by right-clicking the file and selecting <em>Properties</em>. The resulting window should show the directory path.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now execute the JavaScript file by running:</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">node hello.js
</code></pre>
<p>This should again print &quot;Hello, world!&quot;:</p>
<p><img src="chapter1/images/node-js-hello-js.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Note that for the remainder of chapter 1 you should follow along using the Node.js console as we will be discussing the language itself. Nevertheless, as we begin writing the project in chapter 2, we will have to write JavaScript for the browser runtime environment on a regular basis.</p>
<h3 id="statements-and-expressions"><a class="header" href="#statements-and-expressions">Statements and expressions</a></h3>
<p>Before we dive into JavaScript, you should know what statements and expressions are.</p>
<p>A <strong>statement</strong> is a syntactic unit responsible for executing some action. A program is then essentially a sequence of statements which should be executed when running the program. For example <code>console.log('Hello, world!')</code> is a statement which executes the action of printing &quot;Hello, world!&quot; to the console.</p>
<p>An <strong>expression</strong> is a syntactic unit that may be evaluated to get its value. For example <code>2 + 2</code> would be an expression which would evaluate to <code>4</code>. Note that since any expression also executes some action, any expression is therefore a statement.</p>
<p>You could put it this way: Statements in general are executed to make something happen, while expressions in specific are evaluated to produce a value.</p>
<h3 id="comments"><a class="header" href="#comments">Comments</a></h3>
<p>Everything that is after a double slash on a line in JavaScript is a <strong>comment</strong>. Comments are ignored by the runtime and therefore have no effect for the execution of your program:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">// This is just a comment
// Comments have no effect
console.log('Hello, world!');
// Therefore this program is equivalent to the
// program from the previous chapter
</code></pre>
<p>We will heavily utilize comments throughout this book inside the code blocks to highlight important ideas.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is a lot of discussion on how much you should comment your programs. We will return to this when discussing functions. However one rule is that if your code is so terrible that it requires <em>extensive commentary</em> to explain its behavior or purpose, you should fix the code. Just like a work of art, your code should stand on it's own merits. Imagine <em>commenting</em> a work of art (oh, wait)... However it is better to have terrible code and comments than have terrible code and no comments.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We will also adopt the convention that if a comment is next to a line with a <code>console.log</code> statement, that comment shows the output that would be logged to the console if the code was run. For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">console.log('Hello, world!'); // Hello, world!
</code></pre>
<p>This is the point where we tell you that while you are reading this book you should <em>absolutely follow along in some runtime</em> (probably Node.js, but a browser is fine too). This is <em>very important</em>. Go ahead and open a Node.js console <em>now</em>.</p>
<p>Come on, we'll wait...</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>...</p>
<p><em>Finally</em>. Let's move on.</p>

<h3 id="variables"><a class="header" href="#variables">Variables</a></h3>
<p>Whenever we write programs, we need to manipulate data. This data needs to be stored somewhere and we need to be able to access it somehow. We also need to deal with the fact that when we execute a program, the values we deal with are not predictable in advance. For example we don't know which tasks a user might create. Nevertheless, we must be able to access created tasks through a predictable name like <code>tasks</code> or <code>createdTasks</code>. Therefore we need a way to put an <em>unpredictable</em> value in storage and refer to it using a <em>predictable</em> name.</p>
<p>A <strong>variable</strong> is just that - a storage location containing a value which is referred to by a symbolic name. This <em>sounds</em> really fancy, but it just means that there is a value somewhere in your storage and you can refer to that value using a predictable name (even if the value itself is not predictable).</p>
<p>For example you could have a variable <code>x</code> which has the value <code>5</code> (we say that <code>x</code> is equal to <code>5</code>):</p>
<p><img src="chapter1/images/variable.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Now even if the value of <code>x</code> changes (e.g. to <code>6</code>), the variable name doesn't change, only the value does. That is the variable name is still <code>x</code>, however now <code>x</code> has the value <code>6</code> (i.e. <code>x</code> is equal to <code>6</code>):</p>
<p><img src="chapter1/images/variable-changed.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>JavaScript lets you declare variables with the <code>let</code> keyword. You can assign values to variables using the <strong>assignment operator</strong> (<code>=</code>):</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">// Declare a variable
let x;

// Assign a value to a variable
x = 10;
</code></pre>
<p>We can print the value of the variable using the <code>console.log</code> method:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">console.log(x); // 10
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>If you follow along in the Node.js (or browser) console, you don't actually need to use the <code>console.log</code> method to print the value of a variable. Instead you can simply type the variable (or any expression for that matter) and the console will display its value.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can also have a declaration and an assignment on a single line. In fact, this is usually the way to go:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">let y = 10;
</code></pre>
<p>The value of a variable may change over the course of a program:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">let y = 10;
console.log(y); // 10

// Assign a new value to the variable
y = 20;
console.log(y); // 20
</code></pre>
<p>This will print <code>10</code> first and then <code>20</code>.</p>
<p>If you want to declare a symbolic name for a value that never changes, you can declare a <strong>constant</strong>. This is done using the <code>const</code> keyword:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">const ten = 10;
</code></pre>
<p>If you try to reassign a value to a constant, you get an error. For example if you do</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">const ten = 10;
ten = 20;
</code></pre>
<p>you get</p>
<pre><code>Uncaught TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.
</code></pre>
<p>You will almost exclusively see us using <code>const</code> instead of <code>let</code> from now on. Reassignment is not nearly as necessary as you might think right now.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You can also declare variables using the <code>var</code> keyword. We will not cover it here and you essentially only need to know one thing about <code>var</code> - you should <em>basically never use it</em>. It's mostly a historical artifact of the language at this point.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Any variable has a <strong>data type</strong> which denotes the range of values it can take and which operations can be performed on the variable. You can use the <code>typeof</code> operator to obtain the data type of a variable.</p>
<p>We begin with the <strong>primitive data types</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="numbers"><a class="header" href="#numbers">Numbers</a></h3>
<p>You've already encountered the <code>Number</code> data type:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">const n = 10;
console.log(typeof n); // number
</code></pre>
<p>Any integer or real number is a <code>Number</code>. So far, so obvious. However there are also some other things which have type <code>Number</code> like <code>Infinity</code>. We don't care about these for now, just keep in mind that JavaScript numbers are more than just integers and reals.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">console.log(typeof 42); // number
console.log(typeof -20); // number
console.log(typeof 3.4); // number
console.log(typeof -1.7); // number
console.log(typeof Infinity); // number
</code></pre>
<p>You can perform arithmetic on numbers using the usual arithmetic operators <code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>*</code> and <code>/</code>. There is also the <code>%</code> (modulo) operator which returns the remainder of a division. Finally, there is the <code>**</code> operator which does exponentiation:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">const a = 3;
const b = 4;
console.log(a + b); // 7
console.log(a - b); // -1
console.log(a * b); // 12
console.log(a / b); // 0.75
console.log(a % b); // 3
console.log(a ** b); // 81
</code></pre>
<h3 id="booleans"><a class="header" href="#booleans">Booleans</a></h3>
<p>Another primitive type is the <code>Boolean</code> type. This allows you to represent values which are either <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">const thisBookIsAwesome = true;
const thisBookSucks = false;
console.log(typeof thisBookIsAwesome); // boolean
console.log(typeof thisBookSucks); // boolean
</code></pre>
<p>You can do simple logic using the logical operators <code>&amp;&amp;</code> (which denotes <strong>and</strong>), <code>||</code> (which denotes <strong>or</strong>) and <code>!</code> (which denotes <strong>not</strong>).</p>
<p>The <code>&amp;&amp;</code> (<em>and</em>) operator takes two values and evaluates to <code>true</code> only if both values are <code>true</code> and to <code>false</code> otherwise:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">console.log(true &amp;&amp; true); // true
console.log(false &amp;&amp; true); // false
console.log(true &amp;&amp; false); // false
console.log(false &amp;&amp; false); // false
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>||</code> (<em>or</em>) operator takes two values and evaluates to <code>true</code> if <em>at least one</em> of the values is <code>true</code> (and to <code>false</code> otherwise):</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">console.log(true || true); // true
console.log(false || true); // true
console.log(true || false); // true
console.log(false || false); // false
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>!</code> (<em>not</em>) operator takes a single value and simply negates it:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">console.log(!true); // false
console.log(!false); // true
</code></pre>
<p>Here is an example with all the operators together:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">const b1 = true;
const b2 = false;
console.log(b1 &amp;&amp; b2); // false
console.log(b1 || b2); // true
console.log(!b1); // false
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that technically all the logical operators can take <em>any</em> value (not just boolean values). The result of the logical operator application is then dependent on whether the values are <em>truthy</em> or <em>falsy</em>. We will discuss this a bit later.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A boolean variable is usually the result of an expression. Often it is the result of an expression containing the <strong>equality operator</strong> (<code>===</code>) which allows us to compare the values of variables:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">const x1 = 5;
const x2 = 10;
const x3 = 5;
console.log(x1 === x1); // true
console.log(x1 === x2); // false
console.log(x1 === x3); // true
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>There is also another equality operator (<code>==</code>). It can be best described as an April Fools' joke that somehow made it into the language. <em>Never use it</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you want to write <em>not equals</em> you can use <code>!==</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">console.log(5 !== 10); // true
console.log(5 !== 5); // false
</code></pre>
<h3 id="strings"><a class="header" href="#strings">Strings</a></h3>
<p>Another primitive data type is the <code>String</code> type. A string is simply a bunch of characters and is used to represent text. Strings are usually written using single quotes in JavaScript: </p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">const s = 'Some text';
console.log(typeof s); // string
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that it's also possible to write strings using double quotes, however in most projects strings are written using single quotes. We will stick to this convention.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <code>+</code> operator works on strings and does concatenation:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">const s1 = 'MERN ';
const s2 = 'book';
console.log(s1 + s2); // MERN book
</code></pre>
<p>Note that instead of doing concatentation all the time you can also use <strong>template strings</strong> (also called template literals). This allows writing JavaScript expressions directly inside strings. Consider the following example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">const s = 'world';
const greeting = `Hello ${s}!`;
console.log(greeting); // Hello world!
</code></pre>
<p>Template strings are written using backticks (<em>not</em> single quotes). They may contain so called <em>placeholders</em> which are expressions embedded inside <code>${...}</code>. These expressions can be any valid JavaScript expression that evaluates to a value implicitly convertible to a string:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">console.log(`2 + 2 = ${2 + 2}`); // 2 + 2 = 4
</code></pre>
<p>You can get the length (i.e. the number of characters) of a string like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">const s = 'MERN book';
console.log(s.length); // 9
</code></pre>
<h3 id="undefined"><a class="header" href="#undefined">Undefined</a></h3>
<p>Finally there is one more primitive type that is of interest to us, namely <code>undefined</code>. There is only one value of this type, which is also called <code>undefined</code>. If a variable has the value <code>undefined</code> this (quite logically) means that it hasn't been defined. For example, whenever you have a variable that has been initialized, but not assigned to, it will automatically have the value and therefore the type <code>undefined</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">let someVariable;
console.log(someVariable); // undefined
console.log(typeof someVariable); // undefined
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that <code>string</code>, <code>number</code>, <code>boolean</code> and <code>undefined</code> are not the only primitive data types. Two other primitive data types are <code>symbol</code> and <code>bigint</code>. And there is one more primitive data type that we will encounter soon.</p>

<div style="text-align: right"> <i> The object of the superior programmer is truthy. <br> — Confucius </i> </div>
<h3 id="arrays"><a class="header" href="#arrays">Arrays</a></h3>
<p>Let's say you are writing a task application (<em>just how did I come up with that example?</em>) and you need to store a bunch of tasks. You could of course declare a separate variable for every task like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">const task1 = 'First task';
const task2 = 'Second task';
const task3 = 'Third task';
</code></pre>
<p>However this would quickly become very <em>tedious</em>. In addition you may want to add or delete tasks. Adding and deleting variables will become even more <em>tedious</em>. It would become almost as <em>tedious</em> as repeating the word <em>tedious</em> over and over. Did we mention that this is really <em>tedious</em>? As you can see, we need a way to store multiple values in a single variable.</p>
<p>A JavaScript <strong>array</strong> is an ordered collection of multiple values. You can declare an array using square brackets:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">const tasks = ['First task', 'Second task', 'Third task'];
</code></pre>
<p>Note that an array is no longer a primitive type, instead arrays have type <code>object</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">console.log(typeof tasks); // object
</code></pre>
<p>You can access individual elements of an array using the index notation. You simply write the name of the array, followed by the position of the element you want to retrieve inside square brackets. Note that when we count the indices (positions), we starts at <code>0</code>, <em>not</em> at <code>1</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">console.log(tasks[0]); // First task
console.log(tasks[1]); // Second task
console.log(tasks[2]); // Third task
</code></pre>
<p>If the array index is too big, trying to access the element at that index will return <code>undefined</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">console.log(tasks[3]); // undefined
</code></pre>
<p>You can get the length of an array by using <code>.length</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">console.log(tasks.length); // 3
</code></pre>
<p>You can change an array element using the index notation and the assignment operator. For example here is how you would change the second element of the <code>tasks</code> array (remember that the second element has index <code>1</code>):</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">tasks[1] = 'Some other task';
console.log(tasks[1]); // Some other task
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that even despite the fact the <code>tasks</code> array is declared as a constant here, you can still change the <em>contents</em> of the array. However you can't <em>reassign</em> <code>tasks</code> to something else, i.e. you can't write something like <code>tasks = [1]</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>JavaScript has some elegant syntax for working with arrays. If you want to assign variables based on values of an array, you would normally have to do something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">const firstTask = tasks[0];
const secondTask = tasks[1];
const thirdTask = tasks[2];
</code></pre>
<p>This is (you guessed it) <em>tedious</em>. Instead you can do this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">const [firstTask, secondTask, thirdTask] = tasks;
</code></pre>
<p>This is called <strong>array destructuring assignment</strong>. If you only care about some of the elements, you can use the <strong>spread</strong> (<code>...</code>) syntax:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">const [firstTask, ...otherTasks] = tasks;
</code></pre>
<p>Something that commonly trips up beginners is trying to <em>copy</em> an array. Let's say you have an array of numbers called <code>arr</code> and you want to create a copy called <code>arr2</code>. You would probably try something like</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4];
const arr2 = arr;
</code></pre>
<p>This is <em>wrong</em>. Let's try changing the first element of <code>arr</code> and look at <code>arr[0]</code> and <code>arr2[0]</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">arr[0] = 5;
console.log(arr[0]); // 5
console.log(arr2[0]); // 5
</code></pre>
<p>Uh-oh! That's probably not what we want. The reason for this behaviour is that <code>arr</code> and <code>arr2</code> both point to the same array. Remember how we were careful to introduce a variable <em>as a storage location together with a symbolic name</em>? Well, it turns out that <em>different symbol names</em> may refer to the <em>exact same storage location</em>. You can visualize it like this:</p>
<p><img src="chapter1/images/array-copy-incorrect.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Here we have a storage location containing the values <code>1</code>, <code>2</code>, <code>3</code> and <code>4</code> somewhere. We also have two symbolic names <code>arr</code> and <code>arr2</code>. While the symbolic names are different, they point to the same storage location. Therefore if we change the storage location, we will observe a change via both symbolic names.</p>
<p>In order to actually copy the storage location as well, we can in fact use the spread syntax as this will <em>copy</em> the values:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">const copied = [...arr];
</code></pre>
<p>Let's check that this indeed an actual copy:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">arr[0] = 5;
console.log(arr[0]); // 5
console.log(copied[0]); // 1
</code></pre>
<p>This looks good. This is the mental picture you should have in your head for copying an array:</p>
<p><img src="chapter1/images/array-copy-correct.png" alt="" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you only briefly skimmed the section on array destructuring and the spread syntax, go right back and read it carefully. These two concepts will come up <em>a lot</em> in the following chapters (much more often than you think right now). </p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="objects"><a class="header" href="#objects">Objects</a></h3>
<p>Let's return to our (yet) imaginary task application. A task will probably be something more than just a string. For example it might contain an ID, a summary and a description. We could again store these in constants:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">const taskId = 1;
const taskSummary = 'Read the MERN book';
const taskDescription = 'Read and understand the MERN book.';
</code></pre>
<p>As you can probably guess, this will quickly become <em>tedious</em> (oh no, not this again). <strong>Objects</strong> to the rescue! These allow us to store name-value pairs inside a single variable:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">const task = {
  id: 1,
  summary: 'Read the MERN book',
  description: 'Read and understand the MERN book.'
};
</code></pre>
<p>Every such value is called a <strong>property</strong>. We can access properties using the dot notation or the square bracket notation. For example to access the <code>summary</code> property of the <code>task</code> object, you would write <code>task.summary</code> or <code>task['summary']</code>. Try it out:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">console.log(task.id); // 1
console.log(task.summary); // Read the MERN book
console.log(task.description); // Read and understand the MERN book.
console.log(task['id']); // 1
console.log(task['summary']); // Read the MERN book
console.log(task['description']); // Read and understand the MERN book.
</code></pre>
<p>Properties don't have to be primitive values. They can also be other objects. Generally speaking, you can arbitrarily nest objects and arrays. For example, here is how you can nest an object inside an object:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">const person = {
  name: 'John Doe',
  task: {
    id: 1,
    summary: 'Read the MERN book',
    description: 'Read and understand the MERN book.'
  }
};
</code></pre>
<p>In this case you can use the <code>.</code> notation to access properties at any nesting level. Let's you want to get the summary of the task that's been assigned to the <code>person</code>. Then you can write <code>person.task.summary</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">console.log(person.task.summary); // Read the MERN book
</code></pre>
<p>If you try to access a property that doesn't exist, the result will be <code>undefined</code> (there it is again):</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">console.log(task.date); // undefined
</code></pre>
<p>Sometimes you want to explicitly indicate that a property may be absent. For example a person may not have a task assigned to them. You could do something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">const person = {
  name: 'John Doe',
  task: undefined
};
</code></pre>
<p>This has the <em>potential</em> problem that someone referring to <code>person.task</code> will have no idea whether it is <code>undefined</code> because the property is not supposed to exist at all or because it it simply absent for this particular person. This is why JavaScript introduced <code>null</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">const person = {
  name: 'Max Mustermann',
  task: null
};
</code></pre>
<p>Basically <code>null</code> allows you to say - &quot;hey, this property does exist in principle, it's just absent for this particular variable&quot;. However note that this is only a convention. There is nothing that prevents you from using <code>undefined</code> to denote absence all the time and in fact we will do so in this very book. Just keep in mind that <code>null</code> exists and that some developers use it to indicate absence (and that it's totally fine to do so).</p>
<p>Remember how we said that there is one more primitive data type left? Well - there it is. The final primitive data type is <code>null</code>. This is something a lot of people are really confused about, because <code>typeof null</code> returns <code>object</code> (and not e.g. <code>null</code>). However this is primarily a technical detail. Despite the fact that <code>null</code> is a separate data type it doesn't hurt to think of it as an object (namely an absent one).</p>
<p>Just as with arrays, you can use <strong>destructuring assignment</strong> when working with objects:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">const task = {
  id: 1,
  summary: 'Read the MERN book',
  description: 'Read and understand the MERN book.'
};
const { id, summary, description } = task;
</code></pre>
<p>And just like with arrays, you can use the spread syntax:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">const taskWithAssignee = {
  assignee: 'Max',
  ...task
};
console.log(taskWithAssignee);
</code></pre>
<p>This will print:</p>
<pre><code>{
  assignee: 'Max',
  id: 1,
  summary: 'Read the MERN book',
  description: 'Read and understand the MERN book.'
}
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that objects are more than just containers for values. We will talk about this in the section on functions.</p>

<p>Quite often, we need to make <em>decisions</em> in our programs. Let's say we want to display a fancy message when a bunch of tasks are completed. This is a decision: <em>If</em> all the tasks are completed, <em>then</em> we want to display a message. Put generally: <em>If</em> a condition holds (is true), <em>then</em> we want to do something.</p>
<p>Conveniently, the language keyword that allows us to accomplish this is called <code>if</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">const completed = true;
if (completed) {
  console.log('Hooray, you completed all your tasks!');
}
</code></pre>
<p>This would print:</p>
<pre><code>Hooray, you completed all your tasks!
</code></pre>
<p>The general form of an <code>if</code> statement looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">if (condition) {
  statements
}
</code></pre>
<p>If <code>condition</code> is true, then the <code>statements</code> inside the curly braces will be executed. If <code>condition</code> is false, nothing will happen.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that technically it suffices if the condition is <em>truthy</em> or <em>falsy</em>. We will ignore this detail for now and return to it in a second.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The simplest condition is a boolean variable. However, nothing prevents us from writing more complex conditions. For example, let's say we have a list of uncompleted tasks (conveniently) named <code>tasks</code>. Then we could check that all tasks have been completed by checking whether <code>tasks</code> is empty (i.e. the length of <code>tasks</code> is zero):</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">if (tasks.length === 0) {
  console.log('Hooray, you completed all your tasks!');
}
</code></pre>
<p>Sometimes you need to do something in one case and something else in another case. The (also conveniently named) <code>else</code> keyword allows you to accomplish exactly that. Let's say that if all the tasks haven't been completed yet, we want to display a different message:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">if (tasks.length === 0) {
  console.log('Hooray, you completed all your tasks!');
} else {
  console.log('You still have some tasks to complete.');
}
</code></pre>
<p>The general form of an <code>if...else</code> statement looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">if (condition) {
  statements1
} else {
  statements2
}
</code></pre>
<p>If <code>condition</code> is true, the statements corresponding to <code>statements1</code> will be executed (i.e. the statements inside the curly braces after the <code>if</code>). If <code>condition</code> is false, the statements corresponding to <code>statements2</code> will be executed (i.e. the statements inside the curly braces after the <code>else</code>).</p>
<p>Also note that there may be multiple statements between the curly braces. This is totally valid:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">if (tasks.length === 0) {
  console.log('Hooray, you completed all your tasks!');
  console.log('Congratulations!');
  console.log('No really, you are amazing!');
} else {
  console.log('You still have some tasks to complete.');
  console.log('Do not despair!');
}
</code></pre>
<p>Assuming <code>tasks</code> has a <code>length</code> of <code>0</code> this will print:</p>
<pre><code>Hooray, you completed all your tasks!
Congratulations!
No really, you are amazing!
</code></pre>
<p>Sometimes you need to handle more than two cases. Since JavaScript was fresh out of keywords at this point, they allowed you to do so using <code>else if</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">if (tasks.length === 0) {
  console.log('Hooray, you completed all your tasks!');
} else if (tasks.length === 1) {
  console.log('Only one task left! Go! Go! Go!');
} else {
  console.log('You still have some tasks to complete.');
}
</code></pre>
<p>The general form of an <code>if...else if...else</code> statement looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">if (condition1) {
  statements1
} else if (condition2) {
  statements2
} /*possibly more else ifs*/ else if (conditionN) {
  statementsN
} else {
  statementsElse
}
</code></pre>
<p>Here all the conditions will be checked one after another. As soon as a condition is true, the corresponding statements will be executed. If no condition matches, the statements corresponding to <code>statementsElse</code> will be executed.</p>
<p>You can have any number of <code>else if</code> statements. For example this is valid:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">if (tasks.length === 0) {
  console.log('Hooray, you completed all your tasks!');
} else if (tasks.length === 1) {
  console.log('Only one task left! Go! Go! Go!');
} else if (tasks.length === 2) {
  console.log('You have two tasks to do.');
} else if (tasks.length === 3) {
  console.log('There are three tasks left.');
} else {
  console.log('You still have some tasks to complete.');
}
</code></pre>
<p>Note that the <code>else</code> block is not required. If it's missing and none of the conditions are true, nothing will happen.</p>
<h3 id="truthiness-and-falsiness"><a class="header" href="#truthiness-and-falsiness">Truthiness and falsiness</a></h3>
<p>Note that the condition does not necessary have to be boolean as JavaScript will automatically convert non-boolean values to booleans. For example you could write something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">if (1) {
  console.log('1 is truthy.');
} else {
  console.log('1 is falsy.');
}
</code></pre>
<p>This will print &quot;1 is truthy.&quot; because JavaScript will consider <code>1</code> to be <code>true</code> in this context since <code>1</code> is a <em>truthy</em> value.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, a <strong>truthy</strong> value is considered to be true when encountered in a boolean context (like a condition). A <strong>falsy</strong> value is considered to be false when encountered in a boolean context. The most important falsy values are <code>false</code>, <code>0</code>, <code>''</code> (empty string), <code>null</code> and <code>undefined</code>. Most other values (like <code>1</code>, <code>[]</code> (empty array), <code>[3]</code>, <code>{ example: 'hello' }</code> etc) are truthy.</p>
<p>Try to <em>avoid using non-boolean values in boolean contexts</em> as it can lead to surprising behaviour. Nevertheless it's still useful to know about truthiness and falsiness, as it will otherwise trip you up in certain cases.</p>
<h3 id="ternary-operator"><a class="header" href="#ternary-operator">Ternary operator</a></h3>
<p>The <strong>ternary operator</strong> takes a <em>condition</em>, an <em>expression to execute if the condition is truthy</em> and an <em>expression to execute if the condition is falsy</em>. It looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">const doneMsg = 'All tasks are done';
const notDoneMsg = 'There are tasks left';
const msg = done ? doneMsg : notDoneMsg;
</code></pre>
<p>The general form is:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">condition ? expression1 : expression2;
</code></pre>
<p>There is a very common thing complete beginners do with ternary operators which looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">const finished = tasks.length === 0 ? true : false;
</code></pre>
<p>You should stop for a second a think about why this is unneccessary.</p>
<p><em>Thought</em> about it? That's right. You can just write</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">const finished = tasks.length === 0;
</code></pre>
<p>Note that you cannot write arbitrary statements inside a ternary operator (and it wouldn't make a lot of sense anyway).</p>
<h3 id="optional-chaining"><a class="header" href="#optional-chaining">Optional chaining</a></h3>
<p>Consider the following task object:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">const mernTask = {
  summary: 'Read the MERN book',
  description: 'Read and understand the MERN book',
  date: {
    day: 8,
    month: 6,
    year: 2022,
  },
};
</code></pre>
<p>Let's say we want to access the day of the task. We can do this by using <code>mernTask.date.day</code>. But what if the day does not have to be present, i.e. is <em>optional</em>? This could e.g. happen because the user didn't enter a task.</p>
<p>The object could look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">const mernTask = {
  summary: 'Read the MERN book',
  description: 'Read and understand the MERN book',
};

// or like this if you were to use `null`
const mernTask = {
  summary: 'Read the MERN book',
  description: 'Read and understand the MERN book',
  date: null,
};
</code></pre>
<p>Then <code>mernTask.date.day</code> will fail with</p>
<pre><code>Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'day')
</code></pre>
<p>This makes sense since <code>mernTask.date</code> will result in <code>undefined</code> and you can't access a property on <code>undefined</code>. But let's say we would like to access the day and setting it to <code>undefined</code> if the <code>date</code> property is not present. Then we would need to do something like the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">const day = typeof mernTask.date !== undefined &amp;&amp; mernTask.date !== null ? mernTask.date.day : undefined;
</code></pre>
<p>Alternatively we could make use of <code>&amp;&amp;</code> and write:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">const day = mernTask.date &amp;&amp; mernTask.date.day;
</code></pre>
<p>Generally consider an object that has a bunch of values that may be absent (i.e. <code>null</code> or <code>undefined</code>). Working with such value will be annoying and only grow more cumbersome with deeper nesting. To avoid all this JavaScript allows you to do <strong>optional chaining</strong>. This works by writing <code>?.</code> instead of <code>.</code> when trying to work on something that may be undefined. The above line would then become:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">const day = mernTask.date?.day;
</code></pre>
<p>Now the result will be <code>undefined</code> instead of giving you a TypeError.</p>
<h3 id="forof-loops"><a class="header" href="#forof-loops">For..of loops</a></h3>
<p><code>For..of</code> loops allow you to <em>iterate over arrays and strings</em> (and some other things that we will cover later on) and perform a task for each element / character. Let's say you want to print all tasks from a list named <code>tasks</code>. You could do it like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">const tasks = ['Task 1', 'Task 2', 'Task 3'];
for (let task of tasks) {
  console.log(task);
}
</code></pre>
<p>This would print</p>
<pre><code>Task 1
Task 2
Task 3
</code></pre>
<p>As we already mentioned, you can use a <code>for..of</code> loop to iterate over a string:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">const str = 'Task';
for (let char of str) {
  console.log(char);
}
</code></pre>
<p>This would print each charachter of the string, i.e.:</p>
<pre><code>T
a
s
k
</code></pre>
<p>The general syntax of a <code>for..of</code> loop is</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">for (let variable of arrayOrString) {
  statements
}
</code></pre>
<p>It should be noted that you if don't change the variable inside the loop, you can and should also declare it as <code>const</code>. Our first example could therefore be rewritten to</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">const tasks = ['Task 1', 'Task 2', 'Task 3'];
for (const task of tasks) {
  console.log(task);
}
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>There are also a bunch of other loops. We will cover them later. This is because you don't need them nearly as often as some people think.</p>

<div style="text-align: right"> <i> "The best time to write a function was twenty years ago. But the second best time is today." <br> "That makes no sense." <br> "Actually, it kind of does if you think about the history of functional programming." <br> — Dialogue between a master and his student </i> </div>
<h3 id="declaring-and-calling-functions"><a class="header" href="#declaring-and-calling-functions">Declaring and calling functions</a></h3>
<p>When programming we often have to perform some common actions over and over again. For example we might want to get the list of tasks assigned to a user at multiple parts within our software. Instead of writing code that (essentially) does the same thing multiple times we could use a <strong>function</strong>.</p>
<p>Within the <strong>function definition</strong> we would specify what statements should be executed. Then we can write a <strong>function call</strong> (also called <strong>function invocation</strong>). This would then actually execute the statements specified in the definition. We can simply group common actions into a function and then just call the function whenever we need the execute those actions.</p>
<p>Here is a very simple function definition:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">function printGreeting() {
  console.log('Hello world!');
}
</code></pre>
<p>Function definitions begin with the <code>function</code> keyword followed by the function name (in this case <code>printGreeting</code>). We will cover the meaning of the parentheses in a second, but the curly braces contain the <em>body</em> of the function. These are all the statements that will be executed when the function is called. In this case we have one statement, which will simply print <code>Hello world!</code> to the console.</p>
<p>You can call / invoke the <code>printGreeting</code> function by writing <code>printGreeting()</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">printGreeting(); // Hello world!
</code></pre>
<p>You can of course have as many statements as you want inside the function body:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">function printGreetings() {
  console.log('Hello world!');
  console.log('Hello again!');
}
</code></pre>
<p>These functions are not particularly interesting since they do the exact same thing for every function call. In this case, we print the exact same greeting(s) every time. But what if we wanted to print a different greeting depending on the user (containing e.g. the user name)?</p>
<p>We can solve this by defining <strong>function parameters</strong>. This allows us to pass values into the function, so that the function can adjust its behaviour. The function parameters go between the parentheses:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">function printGreeting(user) {
  console.log(`Hello ${user}!`);
}

printGreeting('Jane'); // Hello Jane!
</code></pre>
<p>In this example we have a single parameter called <code>user</code>. The function prints the greeting with the appropriate user. Within the function call we then pass the user (in this case <code>Jane</code>) as an <strong>argument</strong> to the function.</p>
<p>We can also <strong>return</strong> values from functions using the <code>return</code> keyword. Here is a function that takes a number and returns the square of it:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">function square(num) {
  return num * num;
}
</code></pre>
<p>We can now use the function as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">const squaredNum = square(3);
console.log(squaredNum); // 9
</code></pre>
<h3 id="functions-are-objects"><a class="header" href="#functions-are-objects">Functions are objects</a></h3>
<p>Despite the fact that you get &quot;function&quot; when you use <code>typeof</code> with a function, functions are really just objects.</p>
<p>This means that we can assign functions as variables, pass them to other functions as arguments and do all the other neat things we can do with primitives and objects. For example we could assign the <code>square</code> function to a variable:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">const square = function square(num) {
  return num * num;
}
</code></pre>
<p>We could then call this like a regular function by doing e.g. <code>square(3)</code>.</p>
<p>This is called a <strong>function expression</strong>. Note that the function may be <strong>anonymous</strong> here (i.e. it doesn't have a name). We could write this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">const square = function(num) {
  return num * num;
}
</code></pre>
<p>The syntax for calling such a function is still the same, e.g. we could write <code>square(3)</code>.</p>
<h3 id="arrow-functions"><a class="header" href="#arrow-functions">Arrow functions</a></h3>
<p>There is a shorthand notation available in JavaScript called the <strong>arrow function</strong> notation. This notation allows you to omit certain keywords in certain situations. For example here is how you could rewrite the <code>square</code> function using the arrow function notation:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">const square = num =&gt; num * num;
</code></pre>
<p>This is much shorter and less <em>tedious</em> (haha) indeed.</p>
<p>For an arrow function you only have to specify the parameter(s), followed by an arrow, followed by the returned value. If you have multiple parameters, you need to put them inside parentheses:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">const add = (x, y) =&gt; x + y;
</code></pre>
<p>You can also have multiple statements in the function body, but then you have to specify the <code>return</code> keyword and surround the statements with curly braces:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">const printAndGreet = user =&gt; {
  const greeting = `Hello ${user}`;
  console.log(greeting);
  return greeting;
};
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see this is not too different from a regular function declaration or expression (unlike the <code>square</code> function, where the arrow notation was much shorter). It is therefore common practice to only use arrow functions for short functions like <code>square</code>. However this is again just convention.</p>
<p>One thing you might have noticed, is that we only showed you <strong>arrow function expressions</strong>. This is not an oversight but stems from the fact that there is no way to write a <strong>function declaration</strong> with the <strong>arrow function notation</strong>. Another difference is that <strong>arrow functions</strong> are <em>always</em> anonymous.</p>
<h3 id="methods"><a class="header" href="#methods">Methods</a></h3>
<p>A method is a function which is a property of an object.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">const greeter = {
  greet: function() {
    console.log(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;);
  }
};
</code></pre>
<p>You can call a method like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">greeter.greet(); // Hello, world!
</code></pre>
<p>Methods can refer to the properties of an object using the <code>this</code> keyword which is simply a reference to the current object:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">const task = {
  id: 1,
  summary: 'Read the MERN book',
  description: 'Read and understand the MERN book.',
  longDescription: function() {
    return `${this.summary}(ID = ${this.id}): ${this.description}`
  }
};
</code></pre>
<p>You can call the method by doing <code>task.longDescription()</code>. This would print:</p>
<pre><code>Read the MERN book(ID = 1): Read and understand the MERN book.
</code></pre>
<p>A method can also change the properties of an object using the <code>this</code> keyword.</p>
<p>We will not dwell on methods for too long, since we will not use them all that often as this would lead to a <em>ghastly</em> thing called <em>Object-Oriented Programming</em> (OOP for short). Instead we want you to think <em>functionally</em>, which is what the next section will be about.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Inevitable disclaimer for <em>certain</em> Java/C#/... people: The sentence about OOP was a joke and used correctly, OOP has its merits. We just wanted to be funny. We're very sorry about that and will now perform the appropriate penance procedure.</p>

<div style="text-align: right"> <i> Gold can't be pure, but functions can. <br> — Ancient Chinese proverb </i> </div>
<h3 id="pure-functions"><a class="header" href="#pure-functions">Pure functions</a></h3>
<p>A function is called <strong>pure</strong> if its outputs (the returned values) depend only on its inputs and if the function does not have any <em>side effects</em> (i.e. it doesn't change program state and doesn't write anything to an external data source). </p>
<p>Here is an example of a pure function:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">const square = x =&gt; x * 2;
</code></pre>
<p>Indeed, the output of <code>square</code> depends only on its input and nothing else. In addition, <code>square</code> doesn't produce any side effects.</p>
<p>Here is an example of a function that is <em>not</em> pure:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">const x = 2;
const addImpure = y =&gt; x + y;
</code></pre>
<p>The output of this function doesn't depend just on its input variables, but also on a global variable <code>x</code>.</p>
<p>Here is another function that's not pure:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">const hello = () =&gt; console.log(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;);
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>hello</code> function has a side effect - it outputs something to the console.</p>
<p>Why do we care about all of this? The fundamental reason is that <em>pure functions are very easy to reason about</em>. There is practically no room for suprising behaviour.</p>
<p>Consider the above <code>square</code> function. It takes an input and produces an output that is dependent <em>only on the input</em>. It doesn't matter what the rest of the program is doing - the function will always produce identical outputs for identical inputs.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you are mathematically inclined, pure functions are basically regular mathematical functions. They take an input which is a member of some domain and produce an output which is a member of some codomain. For example the <code>square</code> function is simply the function f: A → B, f(x) = x² where A and B are certain sets of numbers. Note that A and B are emphatically <em>not</em> equal to the set of real numbers since of course JavaScript cannot represent every possible real number (due to underlying hardware limitatations - computers can't possibly store arbitrarily large numbers).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All of the above is not true for the <code>addImpure</code> function. This function can produce <em>different</em> outputs for identical inputs. This makes it hard very hard to troubleshoot if there is an error. After all you may not know what the (global) state of the program was when the error occured.</p>
<p>Closely related is another very nice property of pure functions - they are <em>easily testable</em>. There is no need to fake dependencies or global state - as the function only takes an input and produces some output. Therefore all you need to do is to call the function, pass some input and check whether the output matches the expected output. We will return to this <em>extensively</em> when we cover testing.</p>
<h3 id="immutability"><a class="header" href="#immutability">Immutability</a></h3>
<p>A variable is <strong>immutable</strong> if it is unchangeable. Otherwise we call it <strong>mutable</strong>. The more mutability we have inside our program the more can go wrong since it's hard to reason about (global) state.</p>
<p>This is where the alert reader might interject - after all, isn't the purpose of a program to do something? And how can we achieve that if we don't change state?</p>
<p>A fundamental correction is in order here - the purpose of every program is not <em>to do something</em>, but to <em>manipulate data</em>. You can of course manipulate data directly by mutating global state.</p>
<p>Consider the following <code>task</code> object:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">const task = {
  id: 1,
  summary: 'Read the MERN book',
  description: 'Read and understand the MERN book.'
}
</code></pre>
<p>Now let's say we want to change the summary:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">task.summary = 'MERN book';
</code></pre>
<p>This works for simple objects and changes. But this will quickly become brittle with growing complexity. <em>Reasoning about state and state changes is really hard.</em></p>
<p>Instead we can create copies of the objects which contain the changes we need:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">const newTask = {
  ...task,
  summary: 'MERN book'
}
</code></pre>
<p>Note that we didn't change the original object, but created a copy of the object with a different summary.</p>
<p>Immutability and pure functions are closely linked. You want to have immutable datastructures which get passed through pure functions to compute results.</p>
<h3 id="higher-order-functions"><a class="header" href="#higher-order-functions">Higher-order functions</a></h3>
<p>We already talked about the fact that JavaScript functions are just objects. We even showed an example of how you can assign a function to a variable:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">const square = num =&gt; num * num;
</code></pre>
<p>However we can do much more. Since functions are just objects we can pass them to other functions. For example let's define a function that repeats some action <code>n</code> times:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">function repeat(fun, n) {
  for (let i = 0; i &lt; n; i++) {
    fun();
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>We can use it like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">const hello = () =&gt; console.log(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;);
repeat(hello, 4);
</code></pre>
<p>This will output:</p>
<pre><code>Hello, world!
Hello, world!
Hello, world!
Hello, world!
</code></pre>
<p>Note that the <code>repeat</code> function doesn't care what <code>fun</code> is - <code>fun</code> could be a simple <code>console.log</code> or a function which produces a simulated universe. All the <code>repeat</code> function does is it simply repeats <code>fun</code> the specified number of times.</p>
<p>Functions which take (or return) functions are called <strong>higher-order functions</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="the-trinity-of-map-reduce-and-filter"><a class="header" href="#the-trinity-of-map-reduce-and-filter">The trinity of map, reduce and filter</a></h3>
<p>We now introduce the three most important higher-order functions - <code>map</code>, <code>reduce</code> and <code>filter</code>. These functions allow you to perform an <em>incredibly</em> rich set of operations on arrays.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We want to use this blockquote to emphasize <em>how often</em> you will be using <code>map</code>, <code>reduce</code> and <code>filter</code>. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>We will use two running examples throughout the section - an array of <code>numbers</code> and an array of <code>tasks</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
const tasks = [
  {
    id: 1,
    summary: 'Read the MERN book',
    description: 'Read and understand the MERN book.',
    timeLogged: 60,
    status: 'In progress'
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    summary: 'Write a task app',
    description: 'Write an awesome task app.',
    timeLogged: 0,
    status: 'Todo'
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    summary: 'Think of a funny joke',
    description: 'Come up with a funny joke to lighten the mood.',
    timeLogged: 120,
    status: 'In progress'
  }
];
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>map</code> function takes one argument - a function <code>f</code> to apply to every element of the array. It returns the array resulting from applying <code>f</code> to every element of the original array.</p>
<p>Let's say we wanted to square all the elements of <code>numbers</code>. We could write something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">const result = [];
for (const number in numbers) {
  result.push(number ** 2);
}
</code></pre>
<p>This is ugly and (you guessed it) <em>tedious</em>. Instead we can (and should) use the <code>map</code> function:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">const result = numbers.map(number =&gt; number ** 2);
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>result</code> array has the following content:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">[ 1, 4, 9, 16 ]
</code></pre>
<p>Consider another example. Let's say we wanted to add a long description to all the <code>tasks</code> based on the summary and the description. We can use the <code>map</code> function again:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">const longTasks = tasks.map(task =&gt; ({
  ...task,
  longDescription: `${task.summary}: ${task.description}`
}));
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>You can see why the spread syntax is so handy. Thanks to this <em>incredible innovation</em>, you only need to explicitly specify the object parts where something interesting happens.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <code>longTasks</code> array will look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">[
  {
    id: 1,
    summary: 'Read the MERN book',
    description: 'Read and understand the MERN book.',
    timeLogged: 60,
    status: 'In progress',
    longDescription: 'Read the MERN book: Read and understand the MERN book.'
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    summary: 'Write a task app',
    description: 'Write an awesome task app.',
    timeLogged: 0,
    status: 'Todo',
    longDescription: 'Write a task app: Write an awesome task app.'
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    summary: 'Think of a funny joke',
    description: 'Come up with a funny joke to lighten the mood.',
    timeLogged: 120,
    status: 'In progress',
    longDescription: 'Think of a funny joke: Come up with a funny joke to lighten the mood.'
  }
]

<p>The <code>filter</code> function allows you to select elements from an array based on some condition. It takes a function <code>f</code> which returns <code>true</code> or <code>false</code> for some input(s). All elements for which <code>f</code> returns <code>true</code> are kept, all elements for which <code>f</code> returns <code>false</code> are thrown away.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A function which returns <code>true</code> or <code>false</code> is commonly referred to as a <em>predicate</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For example let's say we want to select all even elements from <code>numbers</code>. Here is the non-functional way:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">const result = [];
for (const number in numbers) {
  if (number % 2 === 0) {
    result.push(number ** 2);
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Ugh! I don't even want to look at that. For loops and if statements all over the place. Let's rest our eyes and consider the <em>functional</em> approach:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">const result = numbers.filter(number =&gt; number % 2 === 0);
</code></pre>
<p>Consider another example - we might want to select all tasks from the <code>tasks</code> array which have the status 'Todo'. Think for a moment what the appropriate predicate would be.</p>
<p>That's right, it looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">const todoTasks = tasks.filter(task =&gt; task.status === 'Todo');
</code></pre>
<p>Finally there is the <code>reduce</code> function which (you guessed it) <em>reduces</em> an array to a single value. The <code>reduce</code> function moves over an array from left to right and keeps track of a <em>current value</em>. At every element of the array it recomputes the current value based on a function <code>f</code> (this is the first argument of the <code>reduce</code> function). The second argument of the reduce function is the initial value.</p>
<p>Here is how we might compute the sum of an array:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">const sum = numbers.reduce((num, curr) =&gt; num + curr, 0);
</code></pre>
<p>Let's say we would like to compute the total logged time (i.e. the time logged for all the tasks combined). This would look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">const totalTime = tasks.reduce((task, curr) =&gt; task.loggedTime + curr, 0);
</code></pre>

<p>You learned about important functional concepts like pure functions, immutability and higher-order functions. You also learned about the three most important higher-order functions - <code>map</code>, <code>filter</code> and <code>reduce</code>.</p>
